# Legal Document Analysis â€” Multimodal RAG

A PDF-based Legal Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that ingests contracts, agreements, and court rulings, indexes their clauses/sections, and answers legal queries using GPT-4.1. Built with FAISS, LangChain, and LangGraph.

## Features

- PDF ingestion: Extracts text from legal documents using PyPDF2, with OCR fallback for scanned PDFs.

- Clause/Section extraction: Heuristically splits documents into sections, clauses, and articles.

- Metadata-rich indexing: Stores document type, clause numbers, page numbers, section titles, and legal references.

- FAISS vector store: Embeds text chunks using LegalBERT for fast semantic search.

- RAG workflow:

 - Retrieves relevant clauses based on your query.

 - Summarizes and answers legal questions via GPT-4.1.

- Provides top matching clauses for transparency.

- Persistence: Save/load FAISS index and metadata to avoid reprocessing PDFs.

- Streamlit UI: Clean, interactive interface for uploading documents and querying the knowledge base.
